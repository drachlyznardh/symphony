This is the README for <[Symphony of Pew Pew]>, a simple game developed by <[TDB
Games®]> for the LULZ.

 -+- [Internal] -+-

I – <drachlyznardh@roundhousecode.com> – am personally working on this
repository in order to maintain its history as clean as possible. To do that, I
spend time every night invoking the Machine Spirit.

Although the final layout will change eventually, right now this (remote)
repository is populated with a number of branches with a hierarchical structure.
The [master] branch will move by fast-forward only based on [devel]. The [devel]
branch will be updated by [git merge --no-ff] on specific chunchs of history of
one of the topic branches. Topic branches can be updated by member users in any
way the like.

  PLEASE, add & commit only useful content. Remove from each commit object
  files, swap files, logs and every other non-essential content.

  PLEASE, keep the history clean. I can fix it but I will suffer.

  PLEASE, remember to pull (fetch & merge) from each remote branch above the one
  you are working on BEFORE pushing.

  PLEASE, when you push, do it on a TOPIC branch. DO NOT push devel or master.

  PLEASE, do not push for backup. When you push, do it to share useful &
  functional content you believe ready to be released.

Do not fear. Everything in this section is written on the sand, it can be
changed and I am here to answer many of your questions.

 -+- [About TOPIC branches] -+-

As I – <drachlyznardh@roundhousecode.com> – already mentioned in the GIT guide,
topic branches are long-running branches that focus on a specific task. Use the
following section on list and describe the topic branch you introduce.
