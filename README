I – <drachlyznardh@roundhousecode.com> – am personally working on this
repository in order to maintain its history as clean as possible. To do that, I
spend time every night invoking the Machine Spirit.

Although the final layout will change eventually, right now this (remote)
repository is populated with a number of branches with a hierarchical structure.
The [master] branch will move by fast-forward only based on [devel]. The [devel]
branch will be updated by [git merge --no-ff] on specific chunchs of history of
one of the topic branches. Topic branches can be updated by member users in any
way the like.

Do not fear. Everything in this section is written on the sand, it can be
changed and I am here to answer many of your questions.
