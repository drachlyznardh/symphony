I – <drachlyznardh@roundhousecode.com> – am personally working on this
repository in order to maintain its history as clean as possible. To do that, I
spend time every night invoking the Machine Spirit.

Do not fear. Everything in this section is written on the sand, it can be
changed and I am here to answer many of your questions.
