This is the README for <[Symphony of Pew Pew]>, a simple game developed by <[TDB
Games®]> for the LULZ.

I – <drachlyznardh@roundhousecode.com> – am personally working on this
repository in order to maintain its history as clean as possible. To do that, I
spend time every night invoking the Machine Spirit.

Although the final layout will change eventually, right now this (remote)
repository is populated with a number of branches with a hierarchical structure.
The [master] branch will move by fast-forward only based on [devel]. The [devel]
branch will be updated by [git merge --no-ff] on specific chunchs of history of
one of the topic branches. Topic branches can be updated by member users in any
way the like.

Please, add & commit only useful content. Remove from each commit object files,
swap files, logs and every other non-essential content.

Please, keep the history clean. I can fix it but I will suffer.

Please, remember to pull (fetch & merge) from each remote branch above the one
you are working on BEFORE pushing.

Do not fear. Everything in this section is written on the sand, it can be
changed and I am here to answer many of your questions.
