Comments:
Comments in doxygen style for all classes and all public members and methods, in the .hpp
Random comments in the code to help clarifying stuff.

Each class should be defined in its own .hpp file, with its methods implemented in its own .cpp file.
The headers for a class C should include only the superclasses of C and any class that is contained (not pointed) by C. All the other classes should be forward declared and eventually included in the .cpp file.
