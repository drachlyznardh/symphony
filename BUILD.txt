How to build Symphony of Pew Pew
================================

Symphony of Pew Pew – SOPP from now on – depends on Polycode. Download and
compile Polycode before you proceed. Then, get CMake.

How to build the game
---------------------

Now, choose any folder you like to build SOPP; you can build it here or anywere
else; for simplicity, this example will be inside this folder.

  mkdir Build
  cd Build

Now, you must choose a build type, either DEBUG or RELEASE (flags will change
based on this choice). You must also specify the location of Polycode in the
POLYCODE_BASE definition; please specify an absolute path or you'll make CMake
very sad.

It's time to invoke CMake:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release] \
		-DPOLYCODE_BASE=/path/to/Polycode/Release/<your platform>/Framework/ \
		../

CMake will generate a project for your preferred buildsystem. Run it to compile
& link the executable.

How to get ready for distribution
---------------------------------

You shall find a single huge executable called sopp[.exe] and a folder named
resources. For the time being, these two objects constitute the release; archive
them and share.
